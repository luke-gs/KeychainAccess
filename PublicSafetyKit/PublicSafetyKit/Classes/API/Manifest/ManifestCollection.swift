/// A ManifestCollection represents a grouping of manifest items with the Manifest.
///
/// Each manifest item has a "collection" property which is a string value. These can
/// be any string a user wishes to add within the manifest on the MPOL Portal, but
/// there are a set of defined cases that are expected within a manifest, as defined
/// by Gridstone.
/// 
/// To ensure applications only use strings that are specifically known to be "Manifest
/// Collections", you should use the ManifestCollection type. Applications which have
/// their own specific types can extend ManifestCollection, and define new types.
/// 
/// Creating ManifestCollections on the fly, e.g.:
///
///     manifest.entries(for: ManifestCollection(rawValue: "randomString))
///
/// is strongly discouraged. You should declare the Collection explicitly, and then use
/// it in your code.
