## Hyperion

> Hyperion is a hidden plugin drawer that can easily be integrated into any app. The drawer sits discreetly ðŸ™Š under the app so that it is there when you need it and out of the way when you don't. Hyperion plugins are designed to make inspection of your app quick and simple.

### Usage of Hyperion

### Integrate your mPolKit PR in your mPol PR build check:

Larry uses our lovely [Pod Brancher](https://github.com/Gridstone/Pod-Brancher) to sneakily change the branch in the Podfile if you specify it in the body of your PR. 

To use it, add `{kit-branch='MyBranch'}` anywhere in the description of your PR, replacing `MyBranch` with the branch your Kit PR is from.
