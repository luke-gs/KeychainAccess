/// The `ScrollViewInsetManager` manages insets on a scroll view, adding extra scrolling room
/// when a keyboard is present. Users update the standard insets when required, and the manager
/// handles adjusting the content to handle the keyboard where approrpriate.
///
/// `UIScrollView` does not adjust itself to compensate for the location of a keyboard on the 
/// screen.  When a keyboard appears, best practice on iOS is to adjust the insets of the scroll
/// view to allow scrolling beyond the content area. This allows the scroll view to appear blurred
/// behind the keyboard in it's standard position, but gives it the ability to behave as if there
/// is extra content and avoid "rubber banding" effects until it is beyond that portion of the
/// screen.
///
/// `ScrollViewInsetManager` is designed to handle keyboard actions that require updating in
/// unusual ways. This includes navigation actions, where the scroll view updates should be
/// performed after the keyboard action finishes, and rotation events, where updates should
/// wait until all rotations have completed.
