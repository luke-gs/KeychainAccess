/// The Asset Manager for MPOL applications.
///
/// The asset manager allows you to access the assets within different bundles
/// within MPOLKit. You can also register overrides for MPOL standard assets,
/// or add additional items to be managed.
///
/// By default, if you ask for MPOL standard items, MPOL will first check if any
/// custom items have been registered, and use them if it can find it. If no
/// custom item has been registered, or no asset has been found, it will use MPOL
/// default assets.

    /// will be removed.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
